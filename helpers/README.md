# Helper Security Scan

Helper python script to generate the summary of the security scan of the Anchore data.


## Configuration

This is a python3.12 project. To configure the virtual environment just execute:

- Create the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    virtualenv -ppython3.12 .venv
    ```
- Activate the environment
    ```bash
    . .venv/bin/activate
    ```
- Install the required python package
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  
## Execution

You have several options to execute this code. If you want to execute the analysis of
the result of a simple result just follow this command:

```bash
python analysis.py <path to the file>
```

where <path to the file> is the path to the corresponding json file generated by Anchore tool.
(e.g., ../go/Anchore/Keyrock_idm_20240411_1254_anchore.json). Keep in mind that this file has 
been generated previously executing the command:

```bash
scan check Keyrock
```

from the `go` folder.

This will generate the summary of the data together with two histogram of the vulnerabilities 
using the database CVSS v2 and CVSS v3. for our example, the output should be something similar
to the following content:

```bash
File found at: ../go/Anchore/Keyrock_idm_20240411_1254_anchore.json


Summary of vulnerabilities of Keyrock_idm_20240411_1254_anchore.json
